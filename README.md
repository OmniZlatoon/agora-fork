## Repository Structure

This project is organized as a monorepo:

- [`apps/web`](apps/web/README.md): The main frontend application (Next.js). **Please read the [Frontend Guidelines](apps/web/README.md) regarding styles and components before contributing.**
- [`contract`](contract/README.md): Smart contracts and blockchain logic.
- [`docs`](docs/): Detailed platform documentation and guides.

## 📚 Documentation

- [**Ticket Purchase & Stellar Integration Guide**](docs/payments/ticket-purchase-guide.md): Deep dive into the ticketing technical flow.
- [**Stellar Smart Contracts**](docs/contracts/stellar-contract.md): Overview of our on-chain logic.
- [**Database Schema**](docs/DATABASE_SCHEMA.md): Detailed view of the system's data model.

## Backend Architecture (Axum)

The backend is built using **Rust** and the **Axum** web framework, following a clean and modular architecture designed for scalability and maintainability.

### Directory Overview

- `routes/` – API route definitions and versioned endpoints
- `handlers/` – Request handlers (controllers/business logic)
- `models/` – Data models and domain structures
- `utils/` – Shared helpers and utilities
- `config/` – Environment and configuration management
- `main.rs` – Application entry point and server bootstrap
- `lib.rs` – Central module exports

This separation of concerns allows the backend to scale independently, supports clean testing, and keeps business logic isolated from routing and infrastructure code.
